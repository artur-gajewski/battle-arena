- Miniature figure for each player, standard 2" base
- One d20 die for each player
- Tape measure

## Setup

1. Build battle arena on a table
2. Add 3D scenery like rocks, hills, trees, buildings and containers on the arena
3. Lay each player's miniature figure on each corner of the arena
4. Players now choose which figure the play
5. As a last step, player chooses two weapons from the weapon's list

## How to play

Players roll d20 and the one who has the biggest die number starts. Turns go clockwise. Each player turn consist of two actions. Actions can be either MOVE, CLIMB, ATTACK or FOCUS. Player needs to call out his or her intentions to the rest of the palyers before doing the action.

### Move action

In order to move, player needs to consult character sheet to find out the speed (SPD) value. This tells how many inches maximum player can move as an action. Player can move less than the maximum if desired. Movement always is commenced toward one direction, it can not be devided into section of different directions. If player doesn't want to attack, he or she can use two actions to move.

If player wants to position the miniature so that it's peeking from behind the corner, player needs to announce this so that rest of the players know that attacking from behind the corner is done with disadvantage (see below).

### Climb action

If player wants to climb up to another layer or descend to layer below in 3D arena, he or she needs to throw d20 and add strength (STR) modifier to the die result. If the total is 10 or more, the climb is successful. If the total is below 10, the climb is not successful and player doesn't change the layer. Either way, one action is used per climb or descend action.

### Attack action

To attack, the opponent needs to be in clear line-of-sight, meaning that the opponent is seen and visible from the attacker's point of view. To attack, player rolls d20 and adds modifier based on used weapon and distance of a target. The result needs to be above target's armor class (AC).

When attacking with certain weapons, there might be possibility for a multiple shots per attack. Player rolls as many d20 dice as he or she wants to shoot per attack turn, but no more than the weapon's burst count.

When shot or burst of shots are made, no matter what the outcome, attacking player needs to reduce available shots for that weapon by the amount of dice rolled. Once weapon is out of shots, it can not be used for attack any more.

### Focus action

During his or her turn, player can commence a focus action. This action disables player to do any actions during their turn but has one of the following outcomes, chosen by the player:

1. Enable attack with advance in next turn (this is used during next turn only whether attacking or not)
2. Add three (3) shots to selected weapon
3. Add one (1) to hit points, but total amount of hit points should not be more than the initial hit points in character sheet

### Attack with advantage

When attacking with advance, roll 2d20 and select the higher outcome, then add the weapon's attack modifier.

### Attack with disadvantage

If opponent is peeking from behind a corner or is visible with only it's head, player attacks with disadvantage. Roll 2d20 and select the lower outcome, then add the weapon's attack modifier.

### Death and obtaining gear

If a player is shot to death, his or her miniaturre is laid down horizontally on the spot where it was killed. Next player that reaches this spot can select one of the dead player's weapons along with it's available shots. The dead miniature can then be removed from the arena.
